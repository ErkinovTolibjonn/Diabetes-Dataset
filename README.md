ðŸ’‰ Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether a person is diabetic (1) or non-diabetic (0) based on medical features such as glucose level, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, and age.

ðŸš€ Overview

We analyze and visualize the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, clean outliers, and train several classification models to identify the most accurate algorithm for diabetes prediction.
